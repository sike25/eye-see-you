# Unveiling Facial Attributes with Neural Networks

## Authors

Sike and Lee

## Description

Facial attribute recognition is a significant deep learning challenge with extensive applications in human-computer interaction, security, and research. In this project, we build and train neural networks using the classic CelebA dataset to perform facial attribute recognition. This module employs data preprocessing to gain insights in the dataset.

## How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites

- Python version: `Python 3.12.3`

### Installation

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Execution

To run the preprocessing phase, use the notebook provided. Change the directory filename to point to the files in your directory.


### Additional Notes:

- Ensure that all paths and filenames are correct in the commands.
