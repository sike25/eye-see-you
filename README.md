Facial attribute recognition is an important deep learning problem with far reaching applications in human computer interaction, security and research. It is crucial that computers improve at seeing and recognising various pieces of humanity.
In this project, we build a convolutional neural network capable of the robust classification of facial attributes– starting with a few features like age, presented gender, beards, facial expressions, headwear, eyeglasses, etc. Yet, our model will be designed to scale and eventually incorporate a wider range of feature detection in the future.
The dataset in use was sourced from Kaggle (CelebA) and is well-documented, well-maintained and widely applied. It holds 202,599 unique image files, each with 40 binary attributes. We have begun our project by loading, preprocessing and splitting this data for training, validation and testing at 80-10-10. 
Further steps will include building the initial model then a simultaneous iterative process of evaluation and optimisation– by modifying the model architecture and tuning our hyperparameters with the ultimate goal of producing an accurate and adaptable model which can extend to recognise an increasingly broad spectrum of attributes.
