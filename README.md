Facial attribute recognition is an important deep learning problem with far reaching applications in human computer interaction, security and research. 
It is crucial that computers improve at seeing and recognising various pieces of humanity.     
      
In this project, we build a convolutional neural network capable of the robust classification of facial attributes– 
starting with a few features like age, presented gender, beards, facial expressions, headwear, eyeglasses, etc.   
      
The dataset in use was sourced from Kaggle (CelebA) and is well-documented, well-maintained and widely applied. 
It holds 202,599 unique image files, each with 40 binary attributes. We have begun our project by loading, 
normalising and splitting this data for training, validation and testing at 80-10-10.        

Then we have built an initial cnn model that performs up to 89% accuracy. Further steps will include an iterative process of evaluation and optimization– by modifying the model architecture and tuning our hyperparameters with the ultimate goal of producing an 
accurate and adaptable model which can extend to recognise an increasingly broad spectrum of attributes.

**Running The Code**  
1. Download the dataset from [CelebA at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset/data) into the same local directory you downloaded this notebook.  
2. Unzip the folder.  
3. The notebook should run perfectly now.
