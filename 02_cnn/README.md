# Unveiling Facial Attributes with Neural Networks

## Authors

Sike and Lee

## Description

Facial attribute recognition is a significant deep learning challenge with extensive applications in human-computer interaction, security, and research. In this project, we build and train neural networks using the classic CelebA dataset to perform facial attribute recognition. This module employs the use of convolutional neural network.

## How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites

- Python version: `Python 3.12.3`

### Installation

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Execution

To run the model training and save it to the current working directory, use the notebook provided. Change the directory filename to point to the files in your directory.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that all paths and filenames are correct in the commands.
